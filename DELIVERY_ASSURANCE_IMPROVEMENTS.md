# Delivery Assurance Improvements - Complete Summary

This document summarizes all the improvements made to the delivery assurance feature in the go-rabbitmq library.

## Overview

The delivery assurance feature has been significantly enhanced to address critical issues identified in code review and to provide a production-grade, enterprise-ready solution for reliable message delivery.

## Commits on `develop` Branch

1. **`8c07ff8`** - Fix critical race condition with duplicate MessageIDs
2. **`763efdd`** - Improve delivery assurance safety and configurability
3. **`b755682`** - Implement true automatic retries for nacked messages

## Issue #1: Critical Race Condition with Duplicate MessageIDs ‚úÖ

### Problem
The `handleReturn` function used a linear search (O(n)) through the `pendingMessages` map to find messages by MessageID. If two messages with the same MessageID were published while both in-flight, the wrong message could be matched, causing data corruption.

### Solution
Implemented a **dual-map architecture** with O(1) lookups:
- `pendingByMessageID` - For Return notification correlation (keyed by MessageID)
- `pendingByDeliveryTag` - For Confirmation correlation (keyed by DeliveryTag)
- Added duplicate MessageID detection at publish time with clear error message

### Breaking Change
MessageID must now be unique for in-flight messages (which is already best practice).

### Commit
`8c07ff8` - "fix: critical race condition with duplicate MessageIDs in delivery assurance"

## Issue #2: Risky Lock Handling Around Callbacks ‚úÖ

### Problem
The previous implementation used a manual `unlock/callback/relock` pattern that was fragile and error-prone:
```go
pending.mu.Unlock()
callback(messageID, outcome, errorMessage)
pending.mu.Lock()
```

This pattern:
- Made the code difficult to maintain
- Could lead to subtle bugs
- Blocked the handler loop during callback execution
- Coupled user code with library state management

### Solution
Refactored to use **goroutines for callbacks**:
1. Copy all necessary data while holding the lock
2. Launch callback + cleanup in a separate goroutine
3. Let the deferred unlock execute normally

Applied to:
- `tryFinalizeMessage`
- `handleMandatoryGracePeriodExpired`
- `handleTimeout`

### Benefits
- Eliminates manual unlock/relock dance
- Prevents callbacks from blocking the handler loop
- Isolates user code from library state management
- Makes code more maintainable and less error-prone

## Issue #3: Configurable Mandatory Grace Period ‚úÖ

### Problem
The 200ms grace period for mandatory messages was hardcoded, which may not be suitable for high-latency environments.

### Solution
Added `WithMandatoryGracePeriod(duration)` option:
- **Default:** 200ms (suitable for most deployments)
- **Configurable:** For high-latency networks or specific requirements
- **Well-documented:** With examples and guidance

### Example
```go
publisher, err := client.NewPublisher(
    rabbitmq.WithDeliveryAssurance(),
    rabbitmq.WithMandatoryByDefault(true),
    rabbitmq.WithMandatoryGracePeriod(500 * time.Millisecond), // For high-latency networks
)
```

## Issue #4: Incomplete Retry Logic ‚Üí True Automatic Retries ‚úÖ

### Original Problem
The `retryMessage` function didn't actually retry (message body wasn't stored), but the API suggested it would. This was misleading.

### Initial Approach (Rejected)
Document the limitation and improve logging.

### Final Approach (Implemented)
**Completely redesigned the retry feature** to provide two distinct, honest capabilities:

### 1. Removed Misleading API
**Before:** `DeliveryOptions` had `RetryOnNack` and `MaxRetries` fields that suggested automatic retries but didn't work.

**After:** Removed these fields entirely to eliminate confusion.

### 2. Implemented True Automatic Retries (Opt-In)
Added a new publisher-level option: `WithAutomaticRetries(maxAttempts, delay)`

**How it works:**
- When enabled, the publisher clones and stores the full message in memory
- If the broker nacks a message, it automatically re-publishes after a delay
- Retries up to `maxAttempts` times before invoking the final callback
- Each retry is a completely new publish with a new delivery tag

**Example:**
```go
publisher, err := client.NewPublisher(
    rabbitmq.WithDeliveryAssurance(),
    rabbitmq.WithAutomaticRetries(3, 1*time.Second), // 3 retries with 1s delay
)
```

**Memory Trade-off:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Stores full message in memory until confirmed (increased footprint)
- ‚úÖ Provides true at-least-once delivery for critical messages
- ‚úÖ Handles transient broker issues automatically

### 3. Updated Data Structures

**publisherConfig:**
```go
enableAutomaticRetries bool          // Enable true automatic re-publishing
maxRetryAttempts       int           // Maximum number of retry attempts
retryDelay             time.Duration // Delay between retry attempts
```

**pendingMessage:**
```go
OriginalMessage *Message        // Cloned message for retry (nil if retries disabled)
RetryCount      int             // Current retry attempt number
RetryOptions    DeliveryOptions // Original delivery options for retry
```

### 4. Refactored retryMessage Function

**Before:** Logged a warning and invoked callback (didn't actually retry)

**After:** Implements true retry logic:
1. Increments retry count
2. Checks if max attempts exceeded
3. If retries left: waits for delay, then re-publishes message
4. If exhausted: invokes final callback with nack outcome
5. Properly cleans up old pending entry before re-publishing

### Why This Approach is Better

1. **Honest API:** No misleading field names - if retries are enabled, they actually work
2. **Opt-In:** Users explicitly choose the memory trade-off
3. **Publisher-Level:** Retry policy is consistent across all messages
4. **Production-Ready:** Handles transient failures automatically
5. **Clear Documentation:** Warns about memory footprint upfront

### Breaking Change
‚ö†Ô∏è **BREAKING:** Removed `DeliveryOptions.RetryOnNack` and `DeliveryOptions.MaxRetries`

**Migration Path:**
```go
// Before (didn't actually work):
options := DeliveryOptions{
    RetryOnNack: true,
    MaxRetries: 3,
}

// After (actually works):
publisher, err := client.NewPublisher(
    WithDeliveryAssurance(),
    WithAutomaticRetries(3, 1*time.Second),
)
```

## Recommendations for Users

### For Most Use Cases
```go
publisher, err := client.NewPublisher(
    rabbitmq.WithDeliveryAssurance(),
    rabbitmq.WithDefaultDeliveryCallback(myCallback),
)
```

### For High-Latency Networks
```go
publisher, err := client.NewPublisher(
    rabbitmq.WithDeliveryAssurance(),
    rabbitmq.WithMandatoryByDefault(true),
    rabbitmq.WithMandatoryGracePeriod(500 * time.Millisecond),
)
```

### For Critical Messages (At-Least-Once Delivery)
```go
publisher, err := client.NewPublisher(
    rabbitmq.WithDeliveryAssurance(),
    rabbitmq.WithAutomaticRetries(3, 1*time.Second),
)
```

---

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future versions:

1. **Exponential Backoff** - Add option for exponential retry delays
2. **Per-Message Retry Policy** - Allow overriding retry policy per message
3. **Retry Callbacks** - Invoke callback on each retry attempt (not just final)
4. **Metrics** - Track retry counts, success rates, etc.
5. **Circuit Breaker** - Stop retrying if broker is consistently failing
